# Final Assessment (Oct 2016 Intake)

Date: 21 December 2016, 9:30 am - 23 December 2016, 9:30 pm (60 hours)

Location: Remote/On-Site

##How it works?

###1. Build a Rails app based on one of the following themes: 

* Trip Advisor Clone
* Pinterest Clone
* Tinder Clone
* Image Gallery (e.g. Flickr/Instagram)
* Todo list (with picture uploads)
* Recipe Book
* A suggestion app on where to eat/date/have group outings/etc (choose one)
* Game: Hangman (multiplayer)
* Game: Card trading (multiplayer)
* An Auction App
* A Second-Nand Buy and Sell App (e.g. Carousell, mudah.com.my, imsold)

Your app must include *at least* the following 5 features:

1. A user authentication from scratch (sign up/sign in). [This may be a useful resource](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#session) to help you get started.
2. Users should have a concept of roles (for e.g. admin vs regular users).
3. A search functionality (for e.g. search for users, search for products).
4. Integrate with at least 1 external API provider (Twitter, Facebook etc+).
5. Some AJAX functionality.


###2. App planning
Plan your app in Trello and add your lead mentor as a collaborator. Given the time frame, prioritize accordingly on the main features that you would like to focus on.


###3. Write some tests
1. Write some model validation test (for e.g. unique email).
2. Write at least 2 model specs, testing any custom model methods (test for happy and edgy paths).
3. Write at least 1 integration spec using Capybara's library.


###4. When you are done, or when the time's up, *git commit and git push* to your Github repo.


###5. [Schedule a time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qSGtV0bmglm84EeVWCNODgvS9tb2dtabP1u6JY3sVps/edit?usp=sharing) with us for a code review session.
